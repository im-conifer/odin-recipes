    <h1>Taco Bell-Style Mexican Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/mexican-pizza.jpg" alt="a homemade version of Taco Bell's mexican pizza">
    <p>You certainly can't say Taco Bell isn't versatile. A handful of ingredients, smashed into each other and Frankensteined into more-or-less novel items. This one claims to be a pizza. Mamma mia, or whatever.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup refried beans, warmed</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked, taco-seasoned ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup taco sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sliced black olives, if you hate yourself</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chopped green onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil over high heat. Lightly fry each tortilla to golden brown, turning frequently and adding oil as necessary</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400F (200C)</li>
        <li>Place 4 tortillas on a baking sheet and spread 3 tbsp of both refried beans and ground beef evenly over each. Place the remaining tortillas on top.</li>
        <li>Mix the taco sauce and enchilada sauce in a small bowl. Spread 2 tbsp onto each of the tortillas and sprinkle 1/4 cup of each cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese has melted, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and top with diced tomatoes and green onions. Throw those olives in the trash where they belong.</li>
    </ol>
