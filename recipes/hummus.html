        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups dry chickpeas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup tahini paste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>additional extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the chickpeas overnight in cold water</li>
            <li>Rinse the chickpeas and place into a pot and add water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the chickpeas are very soft.</li>
            <li>Reserve some of the water and drain the chickpeas, setting aside a handful to use as garnish. Blend the chickpeas until smooth, slowly adding your olive oil. You can also add the reserved water if needed. At this point, add in the remaining ingredients and continue blending until smoothly incorporated.</li>
            <li>Serve the hummus in a flat dish, garnishing with the remaining whole chickpeas and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        </ol>
